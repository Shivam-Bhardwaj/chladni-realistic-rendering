# New Features in v1.2.0 - Complete Guide

## Interactive Particle Control System

### Dynamic Particle Count Adjustment
The most significant enhancement in v1.2.0 is the ability to adjust particle count in real-time without restarting the simulation.

**How it Works:**
- Slider range: 5,000 to 50,000 particles
- Real-time performance feedback
- Smart recommendations based on your hardware
- Hot-reload capability for instant application

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Green (5K-15K)**: "High Performance, Lower Quality"
- **Blue (15K-35K)**: "Balanced Performance/Quality"  
- **Yellow (35K-50K)**: "Lower Performance, High Quality"

**Performance Impact:**
```
5,000 particles  = ~60+ FPS (Smooth interaction)
15,000 particles = ~45 FPS (Good balance)
30,000 particles = ~30 FPS (High detail)
50,000 particles = ~20 FPS (Maximum quality)
```

### Smart Performance Monitoring
**Real-time FPS Display with Color Coding:**
- **Green (>50 FPS)**: "Excellent" - Can increase particle count
- **Yellow (30-50 FPS)**: "Good" - Optimal balance
- **Red (<20 FPS)**: "Reduce particles!" - Performance warning

**Memory Usage Tracking:**
- Live CUDA memory monitoring
- Percentage usage display
- Optimization suggestions when approaching limits
- Automatic warnings at 80%+ usage

## Universal Display Support

### Automatic Resolution Detection
**Smart Screen Adaptation:**
- Detects your monitor resolution automatically
- Supports everything from 1080p to 8K displays
- Maintains correct aspect ratios on ultrawide monitors
- Automatic fullscreen and windowed mode options

**Example Output:**
```
Detected screen resolution: 5120x2880  // 5K display
Detected screen resolution: 3840x2160  // 4K display
Detected screen resolution: 2560x1440  // 1440p display
```

### Adaptive UI Scaling
**Proportional Interface:**
- 1x scaling for 1080p displays
- 1.5x scaling for 1440p displays
- 2x+ scaling for 4K/5K displays
- Perfect readability at any resolution

**Dynamic Font Sizing:**
- Automatically adjusts text size based on screen DPI
- Maintains consistent visual proportions
- Optimized for high-DPI displays

### Display Modes
**Windowed Mode (Default):**
- Uses 90% of screen space for optimal experience
- Allows multitasking with other applications
- Easy access to system controls

**Fullscreen Mode (Optional):**
- Complete immersion in the simulation
- Maximum screen real estate utilization
- Best for presentations and demonstrations

## Enhanced User Interaction

### Intelligent Mouse Handling
**Problem Solved:** Camera rotation while adjusting GUI controls
**Solution:** ImGui input isolation system

**Before v1.2.0:**
```
Moving slider → Camera rotates unexpectedly
Adjusting particle count → View angle changes
Using dropdown menu → Camera spins
```

**After v1.2.0:**
```
Moving slider → Only slider responds
Adjusting particle count → Camera stays still
Using dropdown menu → Perfect interaction
```

**Technical Implementation:**
```cpp
// Check if ImGui wants to capture mouse input
ImGuiIO& io = ImGui::GetIO();
if (io.WantCaptureMouse) {
    return; // Don't process camera input
}
```

### Improved Control Responsiveness
**Smooth Interactions:**
- No lag when adjusting sliders
- Immediate feedback for all controls
- Consistent behavior across all GUI elements
- Professional-grade user experience

## Advanced Physics Improvements

### Anti-Clustering Algorithm
**Problem Solved:** Particles accumulating at the center of the plate
**Root Cause:** Simple rectangular distribution + center-biased forces

**Old Distribution (v1.1.0):**
```cpp
// Rectangular distribution - prone to clustering
particles[i].position.x = (random - 0.5) * plateSize;
particles[i].position.y = (random - 0.5) * plateSize;
```

**New Distribution (v1.2.0):**
```cpp
// Circular distribution - uniform area coverage
float angle = random * 2π;
float radius = sqrt(random) * plateSize;
particles[i].position.x = radius * cos(angle);
particles[i].position.y = radius * sin(angle);
```

### Center-Damping Force System
**Smart Force Scaling:**
```cpp
// Distance-based force damping
float distanceFromCenter = sqrt(x² + y²);
float centerDamping = max(0.3, min(1.0, distance / (plateSize * 0.2)));
forceScale = baseForcScale * centerDamping;
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents unnatural particle accumulation at origin
- Maintains realistic Chladni pattern formation
- Preserves scientific accuracy of simulation
- Creates more visually appealing distributions

### Enhanced Boundary Conditions
**Improved Particle Containment:**
- Progressive force application near boundaries
- Soft walls instead of hard collisions
- Intelligent particle reset for extreme cases
- Stable simulation at all particle counts
